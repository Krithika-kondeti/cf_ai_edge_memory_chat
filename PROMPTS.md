# AI Prompts Used

AI-assisted coding tools were used to help design and implement this project.

---

## System Prompt

The chatbot uses the following system message:

"You are a friendly, helpful AI chatbot."

This ensures the assistant responds conversationally and helpfully.

---

## User Prompts

User prompts are free-form chat messages entered through the browser interface.

Examples:

- "Hello"
- "Explain Cloudflare Workers"
- "My name is Krithika"
- "What is my name?"

These prompts are stored in Durable Objects and sent to Workers AI for context-aware responses.

## Development Prompts (AI-Assisted Coding)

During development, AI tools were used for:

- Designing the Cloudflare Worker architecture
- Implementing Durable Object memory
- Debugging Workers AI integration
- Writing documentation and deployment instructions

AI assistance was used as a productivity tool while the architecture and implementation decisions were made by the developer.
